# NodeJS Starter

A custom [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) starter project with the following setup:

- [ECMAScript 6](#ecmascript-6)
- [Express Server](#express-server)
- [Unit Specs with Jasmine](#unit-specs-with-jasmine)
- [ES6 Linter](#es6-linter)
- [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)
  - [Docker Setup](#docker)
- [Jenkins Pipeline](#jenkins-pipeline)

This project is meant to be used in a microservice architecture, which is why it intentionally does not include any UI.

## ECMAScript 6

This project uses the [ECMAScript 2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) standard of JavaScript.

We use [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile into ECMAScript 5.

#### Babel Root Plugin

For readable imports, this project uses [babel-plugin-root-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-root-import), which uses `~` to reference the `src` folder. 

Then we can do this:

```javascript
import { userModel } from '~/models/user'
```

which is better than:

```javascript
import { userModel } from './../../../models/user'
```

You can adjust this configuration in the `.babelrc` file.

## Express Server

This project uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a minimalist web framework for Node.js. It's lightweight and great for APIs.

#### Port

The server defaults to port `3000`. You can change it by setting the `PORT` environment variable, for example:

```
PORT=4000 npm run server
```

## Unit Specs with Jasmine

Unit tests leverage the [Jasmine testing framework](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine). They are executed with the standard NPM `test` command.

```
npm test
```

Unit specs:

- must use `.spec.js` as a suffix
- are preferably saved in the `/specs`, but they will be picked up anywhere
- are executed randomly

For your convenience `context()` is also aliased to `describe()`, which helps nested syntax:

```javascript
describe ('login()', () => {
  context ('valid credentials', () => {
    it ('returns true', () => {
      ...
    })
  })
  context ('invalid credentials', () => {
    it ('returns false', () => {
      ...
    })
  })
})
```


## ES6 Linter

This project is also linted for code consistency with the [recommended rule set](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), plus some custom changes, most notably:

[Semicolons](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi) are _not_ allowed:

```javascript
// OK
let foo = bar

// will error
let foo = 'bar';
```

[Spaces](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/space-before-function-paren) are _required_ before the `function` parenthesis:

```javascript
// OK
function (foo) {
  return true
}

// will error
function(foo) {
  return true
}
```

Consistent [spacing inside curly braces](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-curly-spacing), for example:

```javascript
// OK
import { app }

// will error
import {app}
```

To see all adjustments, see the `.eslintrc` file.

#### Autofix Problems

You can autofix most common linting offenses with this command:

```
npm run lint:fix
```

## Development Workflow

In _development_ however, you can leverage auto reloading with:

```
npm run dev
```

which will simultaneously run and watch:

- server
- unit specs
- linter

Or you can run them separately:

```
npm run server
npm run lint:watch
npm run test:watch
```

### Docker

For your convenience, there is an included `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` and helps you jumpstart your microservice architecture.

These presets save you from common gotchas:

- Dockerfile: `package.json` is copied first to avoid the heavy `npm install` step on successive builds.
- `docker-compose.yml`: note that `node_modules` is mounted separately. This is required because native bindings can differ between the container and your development computer.
- Included `.dockerignore` to avoid copying giant `node_modules` folder on build.

Note these files are configured for _development only_. If you plan to use them for development, you will make adjustments, e.g. use a different base image:

## Jenkins Pipeline

There is a sample `Jenkinsfile` which a declarative pipeline including the following common stages:

- checkout
- `npm install`
- run linter
- run unit specs
